<h1>Machine-Learning-project-01</h1>
This is an image classifer project using tensorflow.js. You can download the repo and open index.html in a browser then select an image and click on the classify button to get a result. This is a project I did for making money with machine learning by that piece of garbage Siraj Raval who charged $200 dollars for a course that was nothing but links to medium/internet articles for content.
